Log file formats:

System log (files in /logs directory):

File name: mm-yyyy.log 

1. Day of the month (one or two digits)
2. Time in "hh:mm:ss" format. Note: seconds part may be absent
3. Event type (2/3/4/5/6 for critical/error/warning/notice/info)
4. The rest is event-specific, and could be treated as a string

One event per line, max line length - 255 characters. Encoding - ASCII.

***Watering events log (files in /watering.log directory)***

File name: wat-yyyy.nnn, where yyyy - year, nnn - zone number. Zone number is always 3 digits (padded with zeroes).

First line of file defines columns:

Month,Day,Time,Run time(min),ScheduleID,Adjustment,WUAdjustment

This first line is helpful for applications capable of importing CSV files (e.g. Excel), it is also helps to provide
format information since it defines columns meaning.

The rest of the file consists of the records of the following format:

1. Month (one or two digits)
2. Day of the month (one or two digits)
3. Time in "hh:mm" format
4. Run time in minutes
5. Schedule ID
6. Adjustment
7. Weather underground adjustment

One event per line. ASCII encoding.

***Watering Schedule runs log (files in /watering.log directory)

File name: wat-yyyy.sch, where yyyy - year.

First line of file defines columns:

Month,Day,Time,Schedule run time(min),ScheduleID,Adjustment,WUAdjustment

This first line is helpful for applications capable of importing CSV files (e.g. Excel), it is also helps to provide
format information since it defines columns meaning.

The rest of the file consists of the records of the following format:

1. Month (one or two digits)
2. Day of the month (one or two digits)
3. Time in "hh:mm" format
4. Schedule run time in minutes
5. Schedule ID (100 means "quick schedule")
6. Adjustment
7. Weather underground adjustment

One event per line. ASCII encoding.


***Sensors data***

Water flow meters data (files in /wflow.log directory)
(water flow monitoring is modeled after network devices flow monitoring)

File name: wflmm-yy.nnn, where mm - month, yy - year, nnn - sensor number. Sensor number is always 3 digits (padded with zeroes).

First line of file defines columns:

Day,Time,WaterFlow,Duration(sec)

This first line is helpful for applications capable of importing CSV files (e.g. Excel), it is also used to have easy to use
format information since it defines columns meaning.

The rest of the file consists of the records of the following format:

1. Day of the month (one or two digits)
2. Time in "hh:mm" format
3. Water flow reading as a summary counter (32bit counter, presented as integer value in ASCII - i.e. up to 4294967295)

One event per line. ASCII encoding.

When multiple water flow sensors are installed additional sensors data can be represented by separate files.
Water flow readings are assumed to be in 1/10 of liter.

Water flow readings are provided as a summary counter. Delta (actual amount of water dispensed) can be calculated as a delta from previous reading(s).
There are few caveats and specifics:

- Summary counter can be reset at any time (e.g. station restarted), and this needs to be taken into account when calculating delta
- Summary counter can overflow (32bit), this also needs to be taken into account
- Events can be irregular - there is no specific periodic interval guarantees
- The duration of the water flowing needs to be deduced from the events flow

Typically events will be recorded regularly (every few minutes) while the water is flowing, and will not be recorded when water is not flowing, 
however there may be some events recorded when water is not flowing - e.g. station may report an event on restart etc.




Temperature sensors data (files in /tempr.log directory)

File name: temMM-YY.nnn, where MM - month, YY - year, nnn - sensor number. Sensor number is always 3 digits (padded with zeroes).

First line of file defines columns:

Day,Time,Temperature(F)

This first line is helpful for applications capable of importing CSV files (e.g. Excel), it is also used to have easy to use
format information since it defines columns meaning.

The rest of the file consists of the records of the following format:

1. Day of the month (one or two digits)
2. Time in "hh:mm" format
3. Temperature (e.g. 70.5)

One event per line. ASCII encoding.

Sensor readings represent reading values at the time of the timestamp.
E.g. if the reading is 70.5, it means that at the moment of time defined by the timestamp actual temperature was 70.5F.
Temperature is assumed to be in Fahrenheit.


Humidity sensors data (files in /humid.log directory)

File name: humMM-YY.nnn, where MM - month, YY - year, nnn - sensor number. Sensor number is always 3 digits (padded with zeroes).

First line of file defines columns:

Day,Time,Humidity

This first line is helpful for applications capable of importing CSV files (e.g. Excel), it is also used to have easy to use
format information since it defines columns meaning.

The rest of the file consists of the records of the following format:

1. Day of the month (one or two digits)
2. Time in "hh:mm" format
3. Humidity reading (e.g. 60)

One event per line. ASCII encoding.

Sensor readings represent reading values at the time of the timestamp.
E.g. if the reading is 60, it means that at the moment of time defined by the timestamp actual humidity was 60%.
Humidity is assumed to be in %.


Pressure sensors data (files in /pressure.log directory)

File name: preMM-YY.nnn, where MM - month, YY - year, nnn - sensor number. Sensor number is always 3 digits (padded with zeroes).

First line of file defines columns:

Day,Time,Pressure

This first line is helpful for applications capable of importing CSV files (e.g. Excel), it is also used to have easy to use
format information since it defines columns meaning.

The rest of the file consists of the records of the following format:

1. Day of the month (one or two digits)
2. Time in "hh:mm" format
3. Pressure reading (e.g. 1020)

One event per line. ASCII encoding.

Sensor readings represent reading values at the time of the timestamp.
E.g. if the reading is 1020, it means that at the moment of time defined by the timestamp actual atmospheric pressure was 1020.
Pressure is assumed to be in mbars.
